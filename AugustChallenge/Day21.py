# Given a list of non-overlapping axis-aligned rectangles rects, write a function pick which randomly and uniformily picks an integer point in the space covered by the rectangles.
#
# Note:
#
# An integer point is a point that has integer coordinates.
# A point on the perimeter of a rectangle is included in the space covered by the rectangles.
# ith rectangle = rects[i] = [x1,y1,x2,y2], where [x1, y1] are the integer coordinates of the bottom-left corner, and [x2, y2] are the integer coordinates of the top-right corner.
# length and width of each rectangle does not exceed 2000.
# 1 <= rects.length <= 100
# pick return a point as an array of integer coordinates [p_x, p_y]
# pick is called at most 10000 times.

# Example
# 1:
#
# Input:
# ["Solution", "pick", "pick", "pick"]
# [[[[1, 1, 5, 5]]], [], [], []]
# Output:
# [null, [4, 1], [4, 1], [3, 3]]
# Example
# 2:
#
# Input:
# ["Solution", "pick", "pick", "pick", "pick", "pick"]
# [[[[-2, -2, -1, -1], [1, 0, 3, 0]]], [], [], [], [], []]
# Output:
# [null, [-1, -2], [2, 0], [-2, -1], [3, 0], [-2, -2]]
# Explanation
# of
# Input
# Syntax:
#
# The
# input is two
# lists: the
# subroutines
# called and their
# arguments.Solution
# 's constructor has one argument, the array of rectangles rects. pick has no arguments. Arguments are always wrapped with a list, even if there aren'
# t
# any.
